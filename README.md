how to run this code:
Use command line arguements, you add multiple test cases to the command line arguement to run as multiple test cases at once.

For each test case ran it will output all approaches; greedy by value, greedy by weight, greedy by ratio, our dynamic programming approach, better brute force (with pruning), and lastly brute force (without pruning). 

example command format:
python3 main.py testcase.kp
